Concurrent and Distributed Programming - Project 02

Create a distributed system for astrology management and queries using Web Services. This "API" can be consumed to provide an object with the daily message and other information to be defined by the group, according to the zodiac sign, for example.<br><br>
The server will have functionality to manage the registered information and an option for "differentiated plans" for customers, offering specific features for each plan. For example, the basic plan only provides basic information, while the advanced plan offers, for instance, "the lucky number of the day" to "test your luck" â˜º. Create additional functionalities. Use your imagination! <br><br>
The client should have the option to choose the type of plan they want to connect to and naturally consume the services of that plan. The user should be recognized by their nickname.<br><br>
It is mandatory, in this activity, to use interoperability in the solution. For example, the server in C# and the client in Java, as shown in the examples from the classroom materials.<br><br>
This is your chance to play "Knights of the Zodiac" or impress that special someone with important astrological information. Do your research... Talk to the professor to better define the implementation scope or ideas and variations on the problem.
